Description:   This program forwards DHCP messages between subnets with different sublayer
  broadcast domains. It is similarly to the DHCP relay agent dhcrelay of ISC's
  DHCP, but has the following features which are important for me:

  - Runs as non-root in a chroot-jail
  - Uses "normal" AF_INET sockets; this allows to uses packetfilters to filter
    incoming messages.
  - The DHCP agent IDs can be defined freely
  - Has a small memory footprint when using dietlibc

  It tries to be RFC 2131/2132 and 3046 compliant. Probably it works with BOOTP
  (RFC 951) also, but since the handling of the giaddr field is described
  misleading (see RFC 1542), there may occur problems.
