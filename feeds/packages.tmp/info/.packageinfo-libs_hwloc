Description:   The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a
  portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of the
  hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory
  nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It
  also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory
  information as well as the locality of I/O devices such as network
  interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs.
  This package contains the hwloc utilities.
