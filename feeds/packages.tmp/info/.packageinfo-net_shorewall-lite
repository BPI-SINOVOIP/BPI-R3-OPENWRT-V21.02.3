Description: 	The Shoreline Firewall, is high-level tool for configuring Netfilter.

	Shorewall allows for central administration of multiple IPv4 firewalls
	through use of Shorewall lite. The full Shorewall product is installed
	on a central administrative system where compiled Shorewall scripts are
	generated. These scripts are copied to the firewall systems where they
	run under the control of Shorewall-lite.

	Note: This is the IPv4 implementation of Shorewall.
