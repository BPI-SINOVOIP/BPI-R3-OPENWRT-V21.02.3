Title: EEPROM/boarddata management utility for Atheros WLAN chips
Maintainer: Sergey Ryazanov <ryazanov.s.a@gmail.com>

Type: ipkg
Description:   This utility is intended to investigate the content of Atheros WLAN
  chips EEPROM (OTP, boarddata, ART, etc.). It supports data extraction,
  unpacking, parsing, dumping in a text form, saving binary data for
  further analysis, as well as quick editing of some basic fields (e.g.
  MAC address, etc.).

  The utility supports both data access methods: direct EEPROM (OTP)
  access (via the chip) and offline binary dumps handling.
