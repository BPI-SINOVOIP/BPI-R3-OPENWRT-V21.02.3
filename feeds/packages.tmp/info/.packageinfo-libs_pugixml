Description:   pugixml is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a DOM-like interface
  with rich traversal/modification capabilities, an extremely fast XML parser which
  constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer, and an XPath 1.0 implementation
  for complex data-driven tree queries. Full Unicode support is also available,
  with Unicode interface variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings
  (which happen automatically during parsing/saving).
