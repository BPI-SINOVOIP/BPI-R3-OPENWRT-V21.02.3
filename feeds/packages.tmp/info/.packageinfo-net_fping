Description:   fping is a ping like program which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol
  (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is responding.  fping
  differs from ping in that you can specify any number of targets on the command
  line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping.  Instead of
  sending to one target until it times out or replies, fping will send out a
  ping packet and move on to the next target in a round-robin fashion.
