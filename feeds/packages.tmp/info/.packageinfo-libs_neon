Description:   neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C interface. Features:

  - High-level wrappers for common HTTP and WebDAV operations (GET, MOVE, DELETE, etc)
  - Low-level interface to the HTTP request/response engine, allowing the use of arbitrary HTTP methods, headers, etc.
  - Authentication support including Basic and Digest support, along with GSSAPI-based Negotiate on Unix, and
    SSPI-based Negotiate/NTLM on Win32
  - SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL or GnuTLS; exposing an abstraction layer for verifying server certificates, handling client
    certificates, and examining certificate properties. Smartcard-based client certificates are also supported via a
    PKCS11 wrapper interface.
  - Abstract interface to parsing XML using libxml2 or expat, and wrappers for simplifying handling XML HTTP response bodies
  - WebDAV metadata support; wrappers for PROPFIND and PROPPATCH to simplify property manipulation.
