Description:   libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords. It supports
  a wide variety of both modern and historical hashing methods: yescrypt,
  gost-yescrypt, scrypt, bcrypt, sha512crypt, sha256crypt, md5crypt, SunMD5,
  sha1crypt, NT, bsdicrypt, bigcrypt, and descrypt. It provides the traditional
  Unix crypt and crypt_r interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces
  pioneered by Openwall Linux, crypt_rn, crypt_ra, crypt_gensalt,
  crypt_gensalt_rn, and crypt_gensalt_ra.
