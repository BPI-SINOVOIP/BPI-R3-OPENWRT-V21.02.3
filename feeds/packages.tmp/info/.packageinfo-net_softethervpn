Description: SoftEther VPN ("SoftEther" means "Software Ethernet") is one of the world's most powerful and easy-to-use multi-protocol VPN software developed as an academic
project from University of Tsukuba, Japan. SoftEther VPN has strong compatibility to today's most popular VPN products among the world. It has the interoperability
with OpenVPN, L2TP, IPsec, EtherIP, L2TPv3, Cisco VPN Routers and MS-SSTP VPN Clients. SoftEther VPN is the world's only VPN software which supports SSL-VPN,
OpenVPN, L2TP, EtherIP, L2TPv3 and IPsec as a single VPN software. SoftEther VPN is not only an alternative VPN server to existing VPN products (OpenVPN,
IPsec and MS-SSTP), but has also original strong SSL-VPN protocol to penetrate any kinds of firewalls. Ultra-optimized SSL-VPN Protocol of SoftEther VPN
has very fast throughput, low latency and firewall resistance.
