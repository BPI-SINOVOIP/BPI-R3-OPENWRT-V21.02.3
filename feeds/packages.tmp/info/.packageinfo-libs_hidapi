Description: HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to interface
with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac
OS X.  HIDAPI can be either built as a shared library (.so or .dll) or
can be embedded directly into a target application by adding a single source
file (per platform) and a single header.
