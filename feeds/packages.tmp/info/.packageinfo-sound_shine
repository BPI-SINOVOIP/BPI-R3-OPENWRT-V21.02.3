Title: Super fast fixed-point MP3 encoder
Maintainer: Nicolas Thill <nico@openwrt.org>
Source: shine-3.1.1.tar.gz
License: GPL-2.0
LicenseFiles: COPYING
Type: ipkg
Description:  savonet/shine is a blazing fast mp3 encoding library implemented in fixed-point
 arithmetic. The library can thus be used to perform super fast mp3 encoding on
 architectures without a FPU, such as armel, etc.. It is also, however, also
 super fast on architectures with a FPU!
