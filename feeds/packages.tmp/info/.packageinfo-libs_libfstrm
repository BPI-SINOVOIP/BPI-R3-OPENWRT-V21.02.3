Title: C implementation of the Frame Streams data transport protocol
Maintainer: James Taylor <james@jtaylor.id.au>
Source: fstrm-0.6.0.tar.gz
License: MIT
LicenseFiles: LICENSE
Type: ipkg
Description: fstrm is an optimized C implementation of Frame Streams that includes a fast,
  lockless circular queue implementation and exposes library interfaces for
  setting up a dedicated Frame Streams I/O thread and asynchronously submitting
  data frames for transport from worker threads. It was originally written to
  facilitate the addition of high speed binary logging to DNS servers written
  in C using the dnstap log format.
