Description: 	This tool can be described as a Tiny, Dirty, Linux-and-OSX-Only
	C command that looks for coreutils basic commands (cp, mv, dd, tar,
	gzip/gunzip, cat, etc.) currently running on your system and
	displays the percentage of copied data. It can also show estimated
	time and throughput, and provide a "top-like" mode (monitoring).
	.
	It simply scans `/proc` for interesting commands, and then looks at
	directories `fd` and `fdinfo` to find opened files and seek positions,
	and reports status for the largest file.
	.
	It's very light, and compatible with virtually any command.
	This program was formerly known as 'cv' on github.
