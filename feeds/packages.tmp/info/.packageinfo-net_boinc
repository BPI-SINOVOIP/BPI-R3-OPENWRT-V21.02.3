Description:   The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
  software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
  various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
  desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
  Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
  projects.
 
  This package provides the BOINC core client program that is
  required to participate in any project that uses BOINC to control what
  projects to join and to determine constraints for the computation
  like the percentage of CPU time. OpenWrt does not
  provide the graphical BOINC Manager, but you can connect to this
  machine from the BOINC Manager of your desktop computer.
