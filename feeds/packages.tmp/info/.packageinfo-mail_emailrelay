Description:  Emailrelay is a simple SMTP proxy and store-and-forward message transfer agent (MTA).

 When running as a proxy all e-mail messages can be passed through
 a user-defined program, such as a spam filter, which can drop,
 re-address or edit messages as they pass through. When running
 as a store-and-forward MTA incoming messages are stored in a
 local spool directory, and then forwarded to the next SMTP
 server on request.
