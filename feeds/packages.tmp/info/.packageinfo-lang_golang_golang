Description: The Go programming language is an open source project to make
programmers more productive.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of
multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables
flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to
machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power
of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language
that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

This package provides an assembler, compiler, linker, and compiled
libraries for the Go programming language.
