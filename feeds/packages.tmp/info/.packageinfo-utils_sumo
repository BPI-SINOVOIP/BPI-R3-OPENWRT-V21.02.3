Description:   SUMO is a free and open traffic simulation suite which is available since 2001.
  SUMO allows modelling of intermodal traffic systems including road vehicles,
  public transport and pedestrians. Included with SUMO is a wealth of supporting
  tools which handle tasks such as route finding, visualization, network import
  and emission calculation. SUMO can be enhanced with custom models and provides
  various APIs to remotely control the simulation.
