Description:   Automounting file system implemented in user-space using FUSE. It
  implements the most basic functionality that can be expected by an
  automounter; that is it manages a directory of virtual directories. If
  one of these virtual directories is accessed and is not already
  automounted, afuse will attempt to mount a filesystem onto that
  directory. If the mount succeeds the requested access proceeds as
  normal, otherwise it will fail with an error.
