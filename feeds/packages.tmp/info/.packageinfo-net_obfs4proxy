Title: A Tor pluggable transport proxy, implementing obfs4

Type: ipkg
Description: obfs4proxy is a tool that attempts to circumvent censorship by
transforming the Tor traffic between the client and the bridge. This way
censors, who usually monitor traffic between the client and the bridge,
will see innocent-looking transformed traffic instead of the actual Tor
traffic.

obfs4proxy implements the obfsucation protocols obfs2, obfs3, and obfs4.

It is written in Go and is compliant with the Tor pluggable transports
specification, and its modular architecture allows it to support
multiple pluggable transports.

This package contains both the client and the bridge in a single
program.
