Description: Theora is Xiph.Org's first publicly released video codec, intended
for use within the Foundation's Ogg multimedia streaming system.
Theora is derived directly from On2's VP3 codec; Currently the
encoders are nearly identical, but Theora will make use of new
features supported by the decoder to improve over what is
is possible with VP3.
