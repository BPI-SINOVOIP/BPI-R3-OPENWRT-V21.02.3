Description:   BWPing is a tool to measure bandwidth and response times between two
  hosts using Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request/echo
  reply mechanism. It does not require any special software on the remote
  host. The only requirement is the ability to respond on ICMP echo request
  messages. BWPing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
