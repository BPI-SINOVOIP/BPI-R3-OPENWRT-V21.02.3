Title: Encrypted near-zero-conf mesh routing protocol
Maintainer: William Fleurant <meshnet@protonmail.com>
Source: 
License: GPL-3.0-or-later
Type: ipkg
Description: 	Cjdns implements an encrypted IPv6 network using public-key cryptography for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing. This provides near-zero-configuration networking, and prevents many of the security and scalability issues that plague existing networks.
