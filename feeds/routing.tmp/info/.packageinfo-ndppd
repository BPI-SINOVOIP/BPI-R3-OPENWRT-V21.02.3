Description:  ndppd, or NDP Proxy Daemon, is a daemon that proxies NDP (Neighbor Discovery
 Protocol) messages between interfaces.  ndppd currently only supports Neighbor
 Solicitation Messages and Neighbor Advertisement Messages.

 The ndp_proxy provided by Linux doesn't support listing proxies, and only hosts
 are supported.  No subnets.  ndppd solves this by listening for Neighbor
 Solicitation messages on an interface, then query the internal interfaces for
 that target IP before finally sending a Neighbor Advertisement message.
