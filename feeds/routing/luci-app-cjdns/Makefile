define Package/luci-app-cjdns/description
	Cjdns implements an encrypted IPv6 network using public-key cryptography \
	for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing. \
	This provides near-zero-configuration networking, and prevents many \
	of the security and scalability issues that plague existing networks.
