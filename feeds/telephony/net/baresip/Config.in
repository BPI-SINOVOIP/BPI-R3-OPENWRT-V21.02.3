	  The sole purpose of this symbol is to prevent that the bareSIP
	  video modules, the ones which depend on FFmpeg, are built by
	  default. The reason is that FFmpeg often fails to compile for
	  some targets, causing the bareSIP compile to fail as well.

	  If you want the modules which depend on FFmpeg to become
	  available, select 'y'.
